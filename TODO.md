## Summary

The tenant screening workflow has been successfully implemented with the following features:

1. **Tenant Document Submission**: Tenants can upload required screening documents (ID, income proof, references) through a dedicated form.

2. **Admin Review Process**: Admins can view all pending screenings, review documents, and approve or reject applications with notes.

3. **Verification Status**: Approved tenants get their screening_verified flag set to true, which is displayed as a "Verified Tenant" badge on their homepage.

4. **Application Restrictions**: Only verified tenants can submit lease applications for properties.

5. **Complete UI**: All necessary views are in place for tenant submission, admin review, and status tracking.

The system is now ready for testing the complete tenant screening workflow from document submission to admin approval and lease application restrictions.
